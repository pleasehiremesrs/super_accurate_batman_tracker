## Batman Tracker
This is a super accurate tracker that I developed to track Batman and Robin's patrol routes. I almost died a couple
times collecting the data (ran into the Joker once and Poison Ivy twice which was NOT fun, I had to throw out my 
favorite sweatshirt after that) but I think it was worth it.

### Process
I spent 9 weeks tracking Batman and Robin's movements through the city and recording the places I saw them. It had
about a 2% success rate and I only saw them because I camped the GCPD rooftop for like 5 hours. I thought I was going
to get frostbite. Also, I think Commissioner Gordon thought I was a rat.

### Analysis
I also did a social media analysis because more people than you think post blurry pictures of Batman and Robin on Twitter. 
Obviously, half of them were incredibly blurry (unlike me: I post GREAT photos at @gottemgotham) so it wasn't clear if
they were taking a picture of a trash can or a vigilante but whatever. Anyways, I printed out a giant map of Gotham
using my $100000 printing dollars at Snell and then covered the whole thing with pushpins over the locations people
saw them at.

I then ripped a random algorithm off my Algo slides and then applied it to the data. And voila.

### Usage
Run the main script with `python3 track_batman.py` and it will output Batman's likely location for the day (or night).
